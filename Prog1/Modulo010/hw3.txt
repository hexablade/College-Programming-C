	Exercise 9.1

The two errors that I found where the missing type for the parameter (Height), and the variable declaration of (double product;) outside of the function.
Solution:

My fix looks like this:

double triangle_area(double base, double height)
{
    double product;

    product = base * height;
    return product / 2; 
}

    Exercise 9.3

Function for the Greatest Common Divisor:

int gcd(int m, int n){

    int GCD;
        
    while(n!=0)
{
        GCD = m%n;
        m = n;
        n = GCD;
    
    return GCD;

}
 
    Exercise 9.9

The function will swap the values of i and j, so the outcome would look something like:

i = 2 and j = 1 for the exercise example.

    Exercise 9.14

The error is located in the return statements and they give a compiler warning like this, "warning: control reaches end of non-void function [-Wreturn-type]"

My solution to this problem is the following;

 bool has_zero(int a[], int n)
 {
   double result; 
   int i;

     for(i=0; i<n; i++)
         if(a[i] ==0 )
            result =  true;
         else
            result =  false;
     return result;
 }
  
    Exercise 9.15

double median(double x, double y, double z)
{
  double result;

  if (x <= y)
    if (y <= z) result = y;
    else if (x <= z) result = z;
    else result = x;
  else {
    if (z <= y) result = y;
    else if (x <= z) result = x;
    else result = z;
  }

  return result;
}

    Exercise 9.19

void pb(int n)
{
    if (n != 0){
        pb(n / 2);
        putchar('0' + n % 2);
    }
}

The function output for a number that I entered: 

Enter a number: 20
Output of pb: 10100

where 10100 is the binary representation of the number 20.

A trace of pb's execution would look like this:

pb(20) finds that 20 is not equal to 0, so it continues 
pb(10), which finds that 10 is not equal to 0, so it continues 
pb(5), which finds that 5 is not equal to 0, so it continues
pb(2), which finds that 2 is not equal to 0, so it continues
pb(1), which finds that 1 is not equal to 0, so it continues 
pb(0), which finds that 0 is equal to 0, so it returns, which causes
pb(1), to print 1 and return, which continues
pb(2), to print 0 and return, which continues
pb(5), to print 1 and return, which continues
pb(10), to print 0 and return, which continues
pb(20), to print 0 and return, which continues

    Exercise  10.1

(a) a, b, and c are visible.
(b) a, and d are visible.
(c) a, d, and e are visible.
(d) a and f are visible.
    
    Exercise 10.2
(a) b, c, and d are visible. The local variable c is visible and has the same name as the global variable b. 
(b) b, c, and a are visible. The local variable b is visible and has the same name as the global variable c.
(c) b, c, a, and d are visible. Both a and c share the same name with other variables / parameters.
(d) b, c, and d are visible. The local variable c is visible and has the same name as the global variable c.
