    Exercises 6.1

The outcome is a list of numbers beginning with the 
value of i, which is 1, and ending at 128. The list is the 
outcome of multiplying 2*i, until the value of i is equal
to 128, then it stops.

    Exercise 6.11

The outcome is 20.

    Exercise 8.1
The problem is that when you read the program you would have to locate the declaration of a and make sure that t is one type of its elements.


    Exercise 8.5

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>


int main (int argc, char*args[]){

    int i;
    int a[40] = {1, 1};
    
	printf("%i %i ", a[0], a[1]);
    
    for(i = 2; i < 40; i++){
        a[i] = a[i-1] + a[i - 2];
        printf(“Fib number: %i ”, a[i]);
    }    
    printf(“ \n”);
}

    Exercise 8.8
